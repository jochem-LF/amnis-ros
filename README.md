## Documentation

With the idea of giving next groups a fast way to understand the created code, we have created a website that can be run locally. This website allows to view docs of each node and topic.

To view and serve this documentation locally:

1. pull the repository to your local machine.

2. Install MkDocs and the Material theme in your python enviroment:

   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material mkdocstrings[python]
   ```

3. Serve the documentation:

   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```

4. Open your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
